# Simple PHP Crud Application
This application is a very simple create, read, update, deleate (CRUD) application built in object-orientated php.

## What I learned from this project?
I learned the basics of creating an application in object-orientated php. I learned database connecting, querying, classes, objects, issets,
get and post requests, and much more.
